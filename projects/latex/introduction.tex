\section{Background of the Study}

% Measures of Accuracy for Continuous Glucose Monitoring and Blood Glucose Monitoring Devices

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have been recognized as a key factor for effective glycemic control of diabetic patients \citep{continuous2021}.
CGM refers to automatic, continuous (real-time or periodic) monitoring of users' glucose through invasive, minimally invasive (e.g., small incisions), and non-invasive means.
To date, the acceptable and commercialized CGM approach is through sensor implantation, but it requires lengthy calibrations, sometimes unreliable and minimally-invasive \citep{CGMminimalinvasive}.

Non-invasive techniques through analyte (e.g., glucose solution, interstitial fluid (ISF)) analysis have attracted much interest.
Optical-based methods were proven to yield superior results, achieving strong selectivity of glucose fingerprints on complex analytes such as blood \citep{opticalBest}.
Among the optical-based methods (e.g., far infrared to fluorescence spectroscopy), Raman spectroscopy appears promising due to its insensitivity to water (e.g., as compared to near-infrared) and its ability to accurately measure glucose quantitatively and transcutaneously \citep{directGlucose}.
Anyhow, Raman spectroscopy comes with challenge, as is often confounded with fluorescence artifacts, but of which is commonly countered by adjusting the laser intensity or measuring times.  
The rise of Raman spectroscopy is also timely due to its recent advancement of laser technology~\citep{horibahistory}.

The use of Raman spectroscopy for measuring blood glucose can be dated back as far as 2005.
~\cite{forearm2005} found a strong association ($R^2 = 0.83$) on Raman spectra between crystallized glucose and ISF measured at human forearm.
~\cite{solutionGlucose} confirmed a strong association ($R^2 = 0.91$) on Raman spectra between concentration on glucose solution and ISF measured at mouse ear.
~\cite{directGlucose} demonstrated a new approach to extract glucose scattering by subtracting two Raman signals from two different time points as a direct measurement of glucose in blood.
In addition, they validated that to reliably measure the glucose concentration in blood, the glucose peak ($1125 \text{cm}^{-1}$) should be normalized with protein and lipid peak ($1450 \text{cm}^{-1}$).
They achieved an $R^2 = 0.91$ between actual glycemic and predicted glycemic using Raman spectra measured from a pig's ear.
The measuring site is another important variable. Forearm \citep{forearm2005, forearm2014}, thenar \citep{glucobeam}, and nail fold \citep{ramanNailFold2019} have been chosen as promising measurement sites.
While~\cite{sitecompare} indicates that the forearm is the most effective site when compared to the wrist and index finger, it remains unclear which site is the best due to varying equipment, parameters, and methodology (e.g., how to preprocess) across the papers.
Due to the portability of wearables, there has also been some very recent attempt to deploy Raman spectroscopy on wearable (e.g., smartwatch) commercially~\cite{ramanGlucoseWatch} but the research is still in its infancy.

This research aims to build on previous work by 
(1) confirming the use of Raman scatterings for measuring blood glucose, 
(2) comparing models, and 
(3) developing the first wearable (continuous, non-invasive, pervasive) Raman-based self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) system, primarily for daily users for widespread use.
The accuracy of the glycemic measurement should be comparable to that of the well-respected SpO2 wearable sensor (Apple Watch 6) of ($R^2 = 0.81$, $p < 0.001$)~\citep{applewatchaccuracy}.
This justification was made because Raman spectroscopy was demonstrated to have at most 90\% association with blood glucose. 
In addition, body movements may potentially confound the measurements, so it is advisable to set the objective for daily users rather than for clinical use.


\section{Statement of the Problem}

First, it remains unknown of the effective measuring sites.
Due to methodological variations, it is challenging to compare previous findings.  
In addition, past works have a questionable methodology, i.e., it might be claimed that the great accuracy of glucose prediction may be attributable to the use of the full spectrum which may contain unintended signal artifacts that correlated with glycemic \citep{directGlucose}.
Five successful measuring locations on the human body have been documented. 
However, only the wrist, fingertip, and forearm were compared with the same methodology \citep{sitecompare}.
The nail fold is a promising measuring site because its thin epidermis layer makes it easier for the laser to penetrate the microvessel in the dermis \citep{ramanNailFold2019}.
Thenar has been chosen as a measuring site for a portable Raman-based SMBG device \citep{glucobeam}.
This work seeks to identify the strongest correlation between glucose fingerprint and glycemic using the direct measurement of glucose technique \citep{directGlucose}.

Second, valid feature engineering approach remains to be investigated.  
Particularly, past work used primarily two different approaches. 
The first approach uses statistical-based analysis on full spectrum data with additional preprocessing such as dimension reduction or feature importance \citep{ramanNailFold2019, sitecompare, forearm2005, forearm2014}.
The second method is to normalize the spectrum with either hemoglobin peak (1549 $\text{cm}^{-1}$) \citep{solutionGlucose} or protein and lipid peak (1450 $\text{cm}^{-1}$) \citep{directGlucose} and handpick a smaller set of spectra for modeling \citep{solutionGlucose,directGlucose}.
This work seeks to compare these two methodological approaches on human subjects.

Third, no work has considered the development of wearable Raman-based SMBG.
Developing wearable has several challenges.  
Regrading measuring site, the wrist is the ideal option for measuring sites because it can be easily adopted in the widely use platform (smart band/watch).
This option yields the best pervasiveness but not the accuracy.
The similar situation applies to modeling.
A more complex model may fit the data more accurately in exchange for efficiency.
This work seeks to both develop a practical wearable Raman-based SMBG in daily use to achieve CGM and evaluate the level of compromise in order to archives this goal.
