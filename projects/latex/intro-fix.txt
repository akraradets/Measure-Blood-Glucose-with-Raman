Building a wearable blood glucose device can help diabetes to monitor their glycemic throughout the day. 
The term "wearable" could be seen as a combination of non-invasive, continuous, and portable devices. 

Currently, continuousContinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have been recognized as the a key factor for effective ideal monitoring systems for glycemic control of diabetic patients \citep{continuous2021}.  CGM refers to automatic, continuous (real-time or periodic) monitoring of usersâ€™ glucose through invasive, minimally invasive (e.g., small incisions), and non-invasive means.  To date, the acceptable and commercialized CGM approach is through sensor implantation but of which requires lengthy calibrations, sometimes unreliable and minimally-invasive \citep{CGMminimalinvasive}.
However, current CGM devices are not reliable in terms of accuracy and required sensor implantation which considers being a minimally invasive \citep{CGMminimalinvasive}

Fortunately, the a  

Non-invasive techniques through analyte (e.g., glucose solution, interstitial fluid) analysis noninvasive techniques have been studied as a means to measure glycemic continuouslyhave attracted much interest.  Optical-based methods were proven to yield superior results, achieving strong selectivity of glucose fingerprints on complex samples such as blood \citep{opticalBest}.  Among the optical-based methods (e.g., far infrared to fluorescence spectroscopy), Raman spectroscopy appears promising due to insensitivies to water (e.g., as compared to near-infrared) and its ability to accurately measure glucose transcutaneously \citep{directGlucose}.  Anyhow, Raman spectroscopy comes with challenge, as is often confounded with fluorescence artifacts, but of which is commonly countered by adjusting the laser intensity or measuring schemes.  The rise of Raman spectroscopy is also timely due to its recent advancement of laser technology \cite{website horiba}.. 

The use of Raman spectroscopy can be dated back as far as 2005.  \cite{forearm2005} found a strong association ($r^2 = 0.83$) on Raman spectra between crystallized glucose and interstitial fluid measured at forearm.  \cite{solutionGlucose} confirmed a strong association ($r^2 = 0.91$) on Raman spectra between concentration on glucose solution and interstitial fluid measured at mouse ear.  \cite{directGlucose} demonstrated a new approach to extract glucose scattering by subtracting two Raman signals from two different time points as a direct measurement of glucose in blood. In addition, they validated that to reliably measure the glucose concentration in blood, the glucose peak ( $1125\text{cm}_{-1}$) should be normalized with protein and lipid peak ($1450\textt{cm}_{-1}$).  They achieved a $r^2 = 0.91$ on Raman spectra between predicted and actual glycemic in pig's ear.   The measuring site is another important variable. Forearm \citep{forearm2005, forearm2014}, thenar \citep{glucobeam}, and nail fold \citep{ramanNailFold2019} have been chosen as promising measurement sites. While \cite{sitecompare} indicates that the forearm is the most effective site when compared to the wrist and index finger, it remains unclear which site is the best due to varying equipment, parameters, and methodology (e.g., how to preprocess) across the papers.   Due to the portability of wearables, there has also been some very recent attempt to deploy Raman spectroscopy on wearable (e.g., smartwatch) commercially \cite{ramanGlucoseWatch} but the research is still in its infancy.One important variable that impact the overall design of the wearable device is the measuring site. 

Forearm \citep{forearm2005, forearm2014}, thenar \citep{glucobeam}, and nail fold \citep{ramanNailFold2019} have been selected as measuring sites with promising results. 
While \cite{sitecompare} shows that the forearm is the most effective site compared to the wrist and index finger, it remains unclear which site is the best due to different equipment, parameters, methodology, and analysis styles across the papers.
This research aims to build on previous work by (1) confirming the use of Raman scatterings for measuring blood glucose, (2) comparing models, and (3) developing the first wearable (continuous, non-invasive, pervasive) Raman-based self-monitoring blood glucose (SBG) system, primarily for daily users for widespread use (similar to measuring heart rate) that does not require clinical-level accuracy ($geq$ 95% within $pm$15 mg/dl or $pm$15\%).  This justification was made because Raman spectroscopy was demonstrated to have at most 90% association with blood glucose. In addition, body movements may potentially confound the measurements, so it is advisable to set the objective for daily users rather than for clinical use.



Among techniques, the ones using optical methods yield a better result \citep{opticalBest}.


Ranging from far infrared to fluorescence spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy is the most interesting technique. 
Not only it is insensitive to water, but it is also shown to be able to quantitatively measure glucose transcutaneously \citep{directGlucose}.
Recently, \cite{ramanGlucoseWatch} shows the prototype of a wearable blood glucose smartwatch that employs Raman spectroscopy. 
However, evidence of a workable device is absent.
