% 1. Background: Very specific background; hint the problem.
Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is essential for diabetics to monitor their glycemia (the concentration of sugar or glucose in the blood). By measuring glycemia continuously, the treatment can be further adjusted.
% 2. Problem: Very very measurable problem; start with a signal word like “However”, “Anyhow”, or “Despite”.
However, today equipment is an invasive method that requires the patient to prick themselves.
Thereby, measuring glycemia can not be done continually. 
% 3. Solution: Use verb wisely; explore/investigate/develop/compare.
Fortunately, researchers have shown that glycemia can be measured by observing the light scattering such as the Raman Spectroscopy technique. 
With this method, it is possible to develop portable blood glucose meter equipment that is not only non-invasive but also a continuous method.  
% 4. Key finding (2 - 3 sentences): Summarize ONLY the key findings - it means interesting findings.
Our portable equipment has an accuracy comparable to the clinical glucose meter of choice with an error of less than $\pm$ 0.83 mmol/L. 
Measuring time is less than 2 seconds faster than the standard equipment. 
The portable aspect enables continuous sampling throughout the day. 
% 5. Contributions: Why this is important to be solved; what impact it can bring.
With our equipment, continuous non-invasive SMBG is possible. 
Not only this will help to improve the treatment plan for diabetics but also enables individuals to monitor their glycemia which in turn may improve their diet selection.
