\chapter{LITERATURE REVIEW}\label{literatureReview}

We review the result of Raman spectra when measuring glucose as a solution (mix with water) and blood (glycemic), the linearity relationship of glucose peaks with glucose concentration, and the data modeling.

% \section{Measuring Glucose in blood}

% Measured Raman signal can be seen as four parts \cite{directGlucose}. 
% (1) glucose Raman spectrum (G), (2) tissue (non-glucose) Raman spectrum (T), (3) time-varying tissue background signal ($B_T$), and (4) time-independent system background signal ($B_S$).
% Glucose signals changes according to the amount of glucose that exists in the blood. 
% This means $\Delta G = G_{t_1} - G_{t_2}$ where $G_{t_1}$ and $G_{t_2}$ is glucose signal at time $t_1$ and $t_2$ respectively.
% Tissue Raman is generated by lipids, proteins, and collagen. 
% When measuring the same spot, the tissue Raman stays relatively unchanged.
% This means $\Delta T = T_{t_1} - T_{t_2} \approx 0$.
% For time-varying tissue background and time-independent system background, the difference at two-time points is $\Delta B_T = B_{T_{t_1}} - B_{T_{t_2}}$ and $\Delta B_S = B_{S_{t_1}} - B_{S_{t_2}}$.
% Given the $\Delta t$ is small, $\Delta B_T$ and $\Delta B_S$ is $\approx 0$.

% The Raman signal ($R$) consists of four parts that can be modeled as $R = G + T + B_T + B_S$.
% Then, the $\Delta R$ would be $\Delta G + \Delta T + \Delta B_T + \Delta B_S$.
% It is obvious that, given $\Delta t$ is small, the $\Delta R = \Delta G + 0 + 0 + 0 = G_{t_1} - G_{t_2}$.

\section{Glucose fingerprint}

Once the incident photons hit the glucose, the inelastic scattering occurs and known as a Raman scattering.
In glucose solution (glucose + water), Raman scattering peak at 796, 1060, 1125, and 1366 $\text{cm}^{-1}$.
The intensity of scattered light increase as the concentration of glucose increase \citep{solutionGlucose}. 
This same phenomena occur when measuring Raman scattering of blood \citep{forearm2005, forearm2014, directGlucose, sitecompare}.
In \cite{directGlucose}, after subtracting the two Raman spectra measure at two different time points, the spectra peaks at 1125 $\text{cm}^{-1}$.
Unlike the glucose solution, Raman signal of blood is noisy because of blood contains various substance \citep{ramanNailFold2019}.
To extract the linearity relationship, the 1125 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ has to be normalized with the peaks of protein and lipid (1450 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ \citep{directGlucose}, 1549 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ \citep{solutionGlucose}).

\section{Data modeling}



Full spectrum analysis using partial least squares (PLS)  is widely used \citep{forearm2014, sitecompare, forearm2005, directGlucose}.
The result range from 

Modeling the data with multiple linear regression (MLR) + hand-pick features (911, 1060, 1125, 1450 $\text{cm}^{-1}$) result in prediction correlation $R = 0.85$ for intrasubject cross-validation (CV) and $R = 0.91$ for intersubject CV \citep{directGlucose}.
Full spectrum analysis using partial least squares (PLS) \citep{forearm2014, sitecompare, forearm2005, directGlucose} is widely used, and a few neural network approach \citep{ramanNailFold2019, sitecompare}.
However, comparing model performance is difficult since each paper employs a different preprocessing technique.
For a wearable with power and battery constraints, the suited model should provide good prediction accuracy (over 80\% of Clarke error grid (CEG) zone A) with low usage of resources.


In glucose solution, the concentration of 0.1 - 40 mmol/L of glucose in water and Raman shift at 1125 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ has a linear relationship \cite{solutionGlucose}.
The same case can not be said with blood glucose.
Since blood contains multiple components, using 1125 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ directly will not work. 
\cite{directGlucose} shows that the ratio of 1125 and 1450 (protein/lipid peak) $\text{cm}^{-1}$ yield a linear relationship.
Figure~\ref{fig:bloodGlucose-relative1125} shows that the normalized 1125 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ has a linear relationship with the glucose concentration.
This same procedure is also presented in \citep{solutionGlucose} where 1549 $\text{cm}^{-1}$ is used to normalize the spectrum.
On the other hand, \cite{ramanNailFold2019} uses PCA and BP-ANN with an input layer of 3, a hidden layer of 4, and an output layer of 1. 
While the model achieved an RMSE of 0.27 in intersubject modeling, using PCA is not necessarily means the features in use is a glucose-related feature \citep{directGlucose}.
Adding to the neural network, FFNN is primarily used in modeling glucose in \citep{sitecompare}. 
Without any feature selection, the RMSE of glucose prediction is 3.1 mmol/L and 30.12 mmol after implementing SOM and RReliefF as automatic feature selection.

\section{Concentration Limitation}

The usual blood glucose range of a healthy person can be as low as 0.3 - 1 mmol/L and $<$3 mmol/L for diabeties \citep{solutionGlucose}.
