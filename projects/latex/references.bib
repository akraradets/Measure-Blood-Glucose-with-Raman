   abstract = {Aim To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin co-administration vs the individual agents in patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled with metformin. Methods In this study (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02099110), patients with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥7.5\% and ≤11.0\% (≥58 and ≤97 mmol/mol) with metformin ≥1500 mg/d (n = 1233) were randomized to ertugliflozin 5 (E5) or 15 (E15) mg/d, sitagliptin 100 mg/d (S100) or to co-administration of E5/S100 or E15/S100. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26. Results At Week 26, least squares mean HbA1c reductions from baseline were greater with E5/S100 (−1.5\%) and E15/S100 (−1.5\%) than with individual agents (−1.0\%, −1.1\% and −1.1\% for E5, E15 and S100, respectively; P < .001 for all comparisons). HbA1c <7.0\% (<53 mmol/mol) was achieved by 26.4\%, 31.9\%, 32.8\%, 52.3\% and 49.2\% of patients in the E5, E15, S100, E5/S100 and E15/S100 groups, respectively. Fasting plasma glucose reductions were significantly greater with E5/S100 and E15/S100 compared with individual agents. Body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly decreased with E5/S100 and E15/S100 vs S100 alone. Glycaemic control, body weight and SBP effects of ertugliflozin were maintained to Week 52. Genital mycotic infections were more common among ertugliflozin-treated patients compared with those treated with S100. Incidences of symptomatic hypoglycaemia and adverse events related to hypovolaemia or urinary tract infection were similar among groups. Conclusions In patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes while using metformin, co-administration of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin provided more effective glycaemic control through 52 weeks compared with the individual agents.},

   abstract = {This research was to develop a method for noninvasive and fast blood glucose assay in vivo. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, a more promising technique compared to other methods, was investigated in rats with diabetes and normal rats. Calibration models are generated by two different multivariate strategies: partial least squares (PLS) as linear regression method and artificial neural networks (ANN) as non-linear regression method. The PLS model was optimized individually by considering spectral range, spectral pretreatment methods and number of model factors, while the ANN model was studied individually by selecting spectral pretreatment methods, parameters of network topology, number of hidden neurons, and times of epoch. The results of the validation showed the two models were robust, accurate and repeatable. Compared to the ANN model, the performance of the PLS model was much better, with lower root mean square error of validation (RMSEP) of 0.419 and higher correlation coefficients (R) of 96.22%.}

   abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a chronic illness in the United States affecting nearly 120 million adults, as well as increasing in children under the age of 18. Diabetes was also the 7th leading cause of death in the United States with 270 K deaths in 2017. Diabetes is best managed by tight glycemic control, as achieving near-normal glucose levels is key to reduce the risk of microvascular complications. Currently, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have been recognized as the ideal monitoring systems for glycemic control of diabetic patients. Briefly, a CGM system measures blood glucose levels in subcutaneous tissue by attaching a CGM sensor to the skin, allowing the users to make appropriate modifications to their medical interventions according to experience or empirically derived algorithms. The principles of the glucose sensing employed in the current commercially available CGM systems are mainly electrochemical, and employ the gold standard enzyme, glucose oxidase, as the glucose sensing molecule with the combination of hydrogen peroxide monitoring or with the combination of redox mediator harboring hydrogel. Recently, by employing an abiotic synthetic receptor harboring a fluorescent probe combined with a fluorescent detection system, a chronic CGM was commercialized. In addition, the development of less or non-invasive monitoring sensors targeting glucose in tears, sweat, saliva and urine have become of great interest although their clinical relevancy is still controversial. This review article introduces current and future technological aspects of CGM systems, the flagship technology in biosensor research, which was initiated, matured and is still growing in North America.}

      abstract = { Through the use of enzymatic sensors—inserted subcutaneously in the abdomen or ex vivo by means of microdialysis fluid extraction—real-time minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices estimate blood glucose by measuring a patient's interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose concentration. Signals acquired from the interstitial space are subsequently calibrated with capillary blood glucose samples, a method that has raised certain questions regarding the effects of physiological time lags and of the duration of processing delays built into these devices. The time delay between a blood glucose reading and the value displayed by a continuous glucose monitor consists of the sum of the time lag between ISF and plasma glucose, in addition to the inherent electrochemical sensor delay due to the reaction process and any front-end signal-processing delays required to produce smooth traces. Presented is a review of commercially available, minimally invasive continuous glucose monitors with manufacturer-reported device delays. The data acquisition process for the Medtronic MiniMed (Northridge, CA) continuous glucose monitoring system—CGMS® Gold—and the Guardian® RT monitor is described with associated delays incurred for each processing step. Filter responses for each algorithm are examined using in vitro hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps, as well as with an analysis of fast glucose excursions from a typical meal response. Results demonstrate that the digital filters used by each algorithm do not cause adverse effects to fast physiologic glucose excursions, although nonphysiologic signal characteristics can produce greater delays. }
