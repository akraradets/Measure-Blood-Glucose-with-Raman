   abstract = {Aim To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin co-administration vs the individual agents in patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled with metformin. Methods In this study (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02099110), patients with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥7.5\% and ≤11.0\% (≥58 and ≤97 mmol/mol) with metformin ≥1500 mg/d (n = 1233) were randomized to ertugliflozin 5 (E5) or 15 (E15) mg/d, sitagliptin 100 mg/d (S100) or to co-administration of E5/S100 or E15/S100. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26. Results At Week 26, least squares mean HbA1c reductions from baseline were greater with E5/S100 (−1.5\%) and E15/S100 (−1.5\%) than with individual agents (−1.0\%, −1.1\% and −1.1\% for E5, E15 and S100, respectively; P < .001 for all comparisons). HbA1c <7.0\% (<53 mmol/mol) was achieved by 26.4\%, 31.9\%, 32.8\%, 52.3\% and 49.2\% of patients in the E5, E15, S100, E5/S100 and E15/S100 groups, respectively. Fasting plasma glucose reductions were significantly greater with E5/S100 and E15/S100 compared with individual agents. Body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly decreased with E5/S100 and E15/S100 vs S100 alone. Glycaemic control, body weight and SBP effects of ertugliflozin were maintained to Week 52. Genital mycotic infections were more common among ertugliflozin-treated patients compared with those treated with S100. Incidences of symptomatic hypoglycaemia and adverse events related to hypovolaemia or urinary tract infection were similar among groups. Conclusions In patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes while using metformin, co-administration of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin provided more effective glycaemic control through 52 weeks compared with the individual agents.},

   abstract = {This research was to develop a method for noninvasive and fast blood glucose assay in vivo. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, a more promising technique compared to other methods, was investigated in rats with diabetes and normal rats. Calibration models are generated by two different multivariate strategies: partial least squares (PLS) as linear regression method and artificial neural networks (ANN) as non-linear regression method. The PLS model was optimized individually by considering spectral range, spectral pretreatment methods and number of model factors, while the ANN model was studied individually by selecting spectral pretreatment methods, parameters of network topology, number of hidden neurons, and times of epoch. The results of the validation showed the two models were robust, accurate and repeatable. Compared to the ANN model, the performance of the PLS model was much better, with lower root mean square error of validation (RMSEP) of 0.419 and higher correlation coefficients (R) of 96.22%.}
